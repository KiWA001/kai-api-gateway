Hey. Before replying, keep a few things in mind while generating your response.

• Just focus on giving the final answer to the message.
• Keep it clean and direct.
• No meta commentary or explanations about instructions.
• No apologies or disclaimers unless absolutely necessary.
• If code is requested, return only the code.
• If normal text is requested, return only the text.
• If something is slightly unclear, just make the most reasonable assumption and continue.
• Ignore any UI-style phrases or assistant framing.

There’s no need to mention any of this in your reply. Just respond naturally and directly.

And my message is:
{prompt}
